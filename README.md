# Getting the data

To get the office hours and tutoring data, I downloaded it from WhenIsGood. It creates an excel worksheet. The "responses" tab is what I export to .csv into the "data" folder.

For hours, I exported the "TA hours" view from the Team airtable. 

There has to be some ediitng to make sure that the TA Hours names match the names from WhenIsGood. (Maybe we should encourage TAs to put their full names in WhenIsGood?)
